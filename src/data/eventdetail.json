All the wires coming out of the bot should be stacked as a single unit. The wires should be properly insulated. Teams are suggested to use only rated wires such as ISI marked. Loose connections or improper wiring may lead to immediate disqualification even before the event. If the bot is controlled wirelessly, the bot must at least have a four-frequency remote control circuit or two dual control circuits which may be interchanged before the start of the race to avoid frequency interference with other teams. The case of any interference in the wireless systems will not be considered for rematch or results. Remote control systems from toys are allowed. Remote control systems available in the market may also be used. Battery and Power: The machine can be powered electrically only. Batteries must be sealed, immobilized- electrolyte types (such as Li-ion, NiCd, NiMH or dry cells). Working voltages must not exceed 24V DC (mean voltage) at any point in time. All power connections must be of an adequate grade and adequately insulated. Cables must be routed to minimize the chances of being cut. All efforts must be made to protect battery terminals from a direct short and causing a battery fire, failure to do so will cause immediate disqualification. Battery Eliminators are allowed and power source would be available at the venue for the eliminators.\n\nMotors:\n\nThe robot should move as fast as possible around the arena with the help of motors. DC motors and stepper motors (12V-24V) can be used as per the design of bots. Note: We are not responsible for any damage that your bot may incur during the event.\n\nScore Card: \n\nThe score card is based upon the arena formulation. It is obvious that the robot with an extraordinary dynamism will succeed by thrusting out its combatant from the arena.\nIf a robot is pushed beyond the ring, the round ends and the other team is awarded the points.\nThe first team to win X rounds will get through to the Finals where X will be intimated on the day of the competition. Ultimately, if any of the combatants rolls out from the arena it will directly be eliminated from the War Field.\nCriteria for triumph: A robot will be declared immobile if it cannot demonstrate linear motion of at least one inch in a timed period of 30 seconds. A bot with one side of its drive train disabled will not be counted out if it can demonstrate some degree of controlled movement. If both robots survive the 5 minutes, the robot with the higher scorecard points wins. The winner advances to the next round while the loser is eliminated from the tournament.\n\nPre-registration form: https://forms.gle/BHSsypYWex5T83ET8",
